#### Using conventional commit

## Both type and message need to be stated in commit message, or els the commit fails

###### Always Remember:

- use only lowercase letter, make it short and sweet

**fails:**
git commit: -m "first commit"
git commit: -m "fiii: first commit"
git commit: -m "Fix: first commit"
git commit: -m "fix: First commit"

**Passes:**
git commit: -m "fix: viewports responsive"
git commit: -m "docs: add readme"
git commit: -m "feat: add newsfeed feature"

###### Common Types:

build
chore
ci
docs
feat
fix
perf
refactor
revert
style
test
